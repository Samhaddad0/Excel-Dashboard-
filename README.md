🚴‍♂️ Bike Sales Analysis — Data Analytics Dashboard:


📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes bike purchase behavior using demographic and lifestyle attributes. The dataset contains 1,026 records including customer income, age, commute distance, occupation, education, and bike purchase status.
I built a dashboard and exploratory analysis to uncover which customer segments are most likely to purchase a bike — enabling data-driven marketing strategies & sales optimization.


🎯 Business Objective

Which customer segments are most likely to purchase a bike — and how can a business target them effectively?
To answer this, the analysis focuses on:
  1-Demographic trends (Age, Gender, Marital Status, Income Level)
  2-Lifestyle patterns (Commute Distance, Occupation, Education, Cars Owned)
  3-Regional sales comparison
  4-Identifying purchase drivers using data analysis

| Insight                                                                      | Business Implication                              |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Customers aged **35–55** show the highest bike purchase rate                 | Target this group with fitness & health campaigns |
| **Income above $60K** strongly correlates with purchases                     | Market premium bikes or subscription plans        |
| **Longer commute distance → higher probability of purchase**                 | Promote environmental & cost-saving benefits      |
| **Single professionals** buy more bikes than married customers with children | Lifestyle-based segmentation works                |
| **North America leads in bike sales**                                        | Potential expansion in Europe & Pacific regions   |
