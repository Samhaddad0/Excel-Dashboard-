🚴‍♂️ Bike Sales Analysis — Data Analytics Dashboard:


📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes bike purchase behavior using demographic and lifestyle attributes. The dataset contains 1,026 records including customer income, age, commute distance, occupation, education, and bike purchase status.
I built a dashboard and exploratory analysis to uncover which customer segments are most likely to purchase a bike — enabling data-driven marketing strategies & sales optimization.


🎯 Business Objective

Which customer segments are most likely to purchase a bike — and how can a business target them effectively?
To answer this, the analysis focuses on:
  1-Demographic trends (Age, Gender, Marital Status, Income Level)
  2-Lifestyle patterns (Commute Distance, Occupation, Education, Cars Owned)
  3-Regional sales comparison
  4-Identifying purchase drivers using data analysis

| **Single professionals** buy more bikes than married customers with children | Lifestyle-based segmentation works                |
| **North America leads in bike sales**                                        | Potential expansion in Europe & Pacific regions   |
